## Important Notes About Running in Google Colab

Google Colab runtimes disconnect frequently. This means that:
- All **local variables are lost** after a disconnect.
- The notebook can sometimes **collapse in the middle of a run**.
- If you try to run cells that depend on lost variables (for example, saving a model after a disconnect), you will get errors.

Because of this, in **Part B**:
- Some cells look redundant. This happened because after a disconnect we had to **re-define objects** or **re-load from Drive** multiple times.
- Example: we trained a model, saved it to Drive, then Colab disconnected. When re-running only the "save" cell, the model variable no longer existed, causing errors.

### Checkpoints (must be placed in Google Drive)

All fine-tuned checkpoints are already stored here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Shared Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JgW6f8UBvL4df6QoXTAgsjZqP03H58Vf?usp=sharing)

#### One-time Setup in Your Google Drive
1. Create a folder: `MyDrive/ADV_DL/` in your own Google Drive.  
2. Copy the shared contents into `MyDrive/ADV_DL/`.

### Running Environment
